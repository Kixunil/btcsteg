This is very simple proof-of-concept script that encrypts your secret message
and hides it into set of Bitcoin addresses.

Dependencies: vanitygen, bitcoin-bash-tools

How it works:

1. Message is encrypted with aes256-cbc
2. Ciphertext is converted to 58
3. Semi-random header informing about ciphertext length mod 3 is prepended to
   ciphertext
4. Ciphertext is sliced into parts up to 3 characters long
5. Each part is passed to vanitygen to generate useful addresses beginning with
   parts of ciphertext

No one should be able to tell if addresses are random or not.
You can make some legitimately looking transactions to/from those
addresses, so your message will be stored in blockchain forever.

You must agree with your friend on how addresses are stored and ordered.

Probably, I won't improve this script anymore but feel free to fork it (and send pull requests).
